  "body": "The Groundwater Statistics Toolbox (GST) is a highly flexible statistical toolbox for deriving greater quantitative value from groundwater monitoring data. The toolbox can be used programmatically from within Matlab 2014b (or later) or using a highly flexible graphical user interface (GUI); which can also be ran as a stand alone Windows 64 bit application (available [here](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/Groundwater-Statistics-Toolbox/releases) )\r\n\r\nCurrently, the toolbox contains a highly flexible groundwater hydrograph time-series modelling framework that facilitates the following (see references for details):\r\n\r\n1. Decomposition of hydrographs into individual drivers, such as climate and pumping\r\n2. Decomposition of hydrographs into time-periods causing observed trends\r\n3. Interpolation or extrapolation of the observed hydrograph.\r\n\r\n### What's New\r\nThe second release of the stand alone application is out! It contains some exciting new features:\r\n- probabilistic calibration (using DREAM) and parameter estimation.\r\n- calibration using Xeon Phi co-processors.\r\n- offloading of calibration to a cluster (only from within Matlab).\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nTo begin using the standalone application, simply download and install the above Windows 64bit executable  (available [here](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/Groundwater-Statistics-Toolbox/releases) ). Below is a screenshot of the GUI. On the left a table shows a list of models available for simulation (only one model is listed) and on the right time-series simulation plots showing the decomposition of the groundwater hydrograph to the influences of climate and pumping extractions.\r\n\r\n![Sceenshot of GUI](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8623994/12466302/b533a804-c027-11e5-8d66-ff1b69e56616.png)\r\n\r\nTo being using the toolbox from within Matlab 2014b (or later), change the current path (within MatLab) to the location where the source code was been saved. To use the GUI from within Matlab, simply input the following command into the Matlab command window: GST. Once the GUI opens, use the Help menu to access the required documentation or open one of the example projects. \r\n\r\nTo use the toolbox programmatically, please first read the model documentation. It can be accessed by opening MatLab and changing the current path (within MatLab) to the 'algorithms' folder. Next, enter the commands below from within the MatLab command window. The documentation that should appear contains details of algorithms and commands to programmatically build an example model. See the references below for technical details.\r\n```\r\n> addpath(genpath(pwd));\r\n> doc GroundwaterStatisticsToolbox;\r\n```\r\n\r\n###About the Researchers.\r\nThe Groundwater Statistics Toolbox has been developed by the following academics at the University of Melbourne:\r\n\r\n1.
