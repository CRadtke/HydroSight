_HydroSight_ is a highly flexible statistical toolbox for quantitative hydrogeological insights. It comprises of a powerful groundwater hydrograph time-series modelling and simulation framework plus a data quality analysis module. Multiple models can be built for one bore, allowing statistical identification of the dominant processes, or 100's of bores can be modelled to quantify aquifer heterogeneity. This flexibility has allowed many users to develop many novel applications such as:

1. Separations of the impacts from pumping and drought over time.
2. Probabilistic estimation of aquifer hydraulic properties.
3. Estimation of the impacts of re-vegetation on groundwater level.
4. Exploration of groundwater management scenarios.
5. Interpolation and extrapolation irregularly observed hydrograph at a daily time-step.

The toolbox can be used from a highly flexible and stand-alone graphical user interface (available [here](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/releases)) or programmatically from within Matlab 2014b (or later). 

### What's New
The next release of the stand alone application is out! It contains some exciting new features:
- probabilistic calibration (using DREAM) and parameter estimation.
- calibration using Xeon Phi co-processors.
- offloading of calibration to a cluster (only from within Matlab).
- Google Groups discussion (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hydrosight). Join now to share ideas, project and issues. 

### Getting Started
To begin using the stand-alone application, simply download and install the above Windows 64bit executable  (available [here](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/releases)). Below is a screenshot of the GUI. On the left a table shows a list of models available for simulation (only one model is listed) and on the right time-series simulation plots showing the decomposition of the groundwater hydrograph to the influences of climate and pumping extractions.

To being using the toolbox from within Matlab 2014b (or later), change the current path (within MatLab) to the location where the source code was been saved. To use the GUI from within Matlab, simply input the following command into the Matlab command window: GST. Once the GUI opens, use the Help menu to access the required documentation or open one of the example projects. 

To use the toolbox programmatically, please first read the model documentation. It can be accessed by opening MatLab and changing the current path (within MatLab) to the 'algorithms' folder. Next, enter the commands below from within the MatLab command window. The documentation that should appear contains details of algorithms and commands to programmatically build an example model. See the references below for technical details.
