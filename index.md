_HydroSight_ is a highly flexible statistical toolbox for quantitative hydrogeological insights. It comprises of a powerful groundwater hydrograph time-series modelling and simulation framework plus a data quality analysis module. Multiple models can be built for one bore, allowing statistical identification of the dominant processes, or 100's of bores can be modelled to quantify aquifer heterogeneity. This flexibility has allowed many users to develop many novel applications such as:

1. Separations of the impacts from pumping and drought over time.
2. Probabilistic estimation of aquifer hydraulic properties.
3. Estimation of the impacts of re-vegetation on groundwater level.
4. Exploration of groundwater management scenarios.
5. Interpolation and extrapolation irregularly observed hydrograph at a daily time-step.

The toolbox can be used from a highly flexible and stand-alone graphical user interface (available [here](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/releases)) or programmatically from within Matlab 2014b (or later). 

### What's New
The next release of the stand alone application is out! It contains some exciting new features:
- Examination of calibrated model fluxes, eg monthly free drainage.
- Modelling with infrequently metered pumping rates.
- probabilistic calibration (using DREAM) and parameter estimation.
- Google Groups discussion (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hydrosight). Join now to share ideas, project and issues. 

### Getting Started
To begin using the stand-alone application, simply download and install the above Windows 64bit executable  (available [here](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/releases)). Alternatively, visit the project wiki at (https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/wiki)
