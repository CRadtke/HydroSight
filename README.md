Groundwater-Statistics-Toolbox
==============================

The Groundwater Statistics Toolbox (GST) is a highly flexible statistical toolbox for getting more quantitiative value from groundwater monitoring data. Currently, the toolbox contains a highly flexible groundwater hydrograph time-series modeling framework that facilitates the following:

1. Decomposition of hydrographs into individual drivers, such as climate and pumping
2. Decomposition of hydrographs into time-periods causing observed trends
3. Interpolation or extrapolation of the observed hydrograph.

Details of the time-series framework are avaiable at:
