Groundwater-Statistics-Toolbox
==============================

The Groundwater Statistics Toolbox (GST) is a highly flexible statistical toolbox for getting more quantitiative value from groundwater monitoring data. Currently, the toolbox contains a highly flexible groundwater hydrograph time-series modeling framework that facilitates the following:

1. Decomposition of hydrographs into individual drivers, such as climate and pumping
2. Decomposition of hydrographs into time-periods causing observed trends
3. Interpolation or extrapolation of the observed hydrograph.

To begin building time-series model, please first read the model documentation. It can be accessed by opening MatLab and changing the current path (within MatLab) to the location of 'GroundwaterStatistics Toolbox.m' within the folder 'algorithms'. Once there, enter the following command within the MatLab command window (ignore the quotation marks): "doc GroundwaterStatisticsToolbox". The documentation that should appear contains details of the model and commands to access an example model. 

Details of the time-series framework are avaiable at:
