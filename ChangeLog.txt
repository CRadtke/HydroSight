This file documents changes to HydroSight from version 1.2.6 onwards.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

13 Feb 2016:
* doIRFconvolution.c: Simpsons 3/8 integration was fund to produce numerical artefacts at daily simulations. This is due to the switching of the integraion for even and odd number of convolution days. This was overcome by use of the Simpsons extended rule. NOTE: the Xeon Phi verion has NOT yet been recompiled.

20 Feb 2017:
* HydroSightModel:integrateData(): local search procedure for kriging edit to ensure points both sides of the estimation time point are included in the temporal kriging.

2 Mar 2017:
* HydroSightModel:integrateData(): Universal kriging equations changed from variogram values to covariances.
* HydroSightModel:calibrateModel(): residuals converted to single data type only when there are >1 parameter sets.

17 Mar 2017
* doDataQualityAnalysis(): rate of change analysis edits to look at rate of change forward in time. Originally a bug caused it to look backward.

17 Mar 2017
* HydroSight_GUI. Version number updated to 1.2.7

22 May 2017
* Error fixed in estimate of residual noise, sigma_n, for TFN and exp. models. It is now derived using the innovations, not residuals.
* Outlier detection now uses an estimate of the residual noise that is a function of time i.e the time between prior observation and the point being assesed.

4 August 2017
* pumpingRate_SAestimation() updated and SP-UCI code and model_TFN.m edited to allow downscaling of infrequent (>daily) groundwater pumping data to daily, weeekly or monthly rates.

16 August 2017
* Bug fixed with SCE-UI while-loop for invalid params.

18 August 2017
* responseFunction_Pearsons.getParameters_physicalLimit() upperlimit for 'A' reduced to log(1/1000) in an attempt to improve est. of free drainage.

18 August 2017
* Alpha version of a new calibration results GUI. It now allows the plotting of the forcing data.

24 August 2017
* Alpha version of a new calibration results GUI extended to handle MCMC outputs and plot model specific outputs eg weighting fucntion plots.
